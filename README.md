# Primality Checker

### What is it?
The Primality Checker determines whether or not a number is prime. If the number is not prime, it also displays the lowest divisor of the number. The Primality Checker uses a naive algorithm improved with heuristics, implemented for simplicity and ease of obtaining a divisor for composite numbers.
