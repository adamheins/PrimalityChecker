# Primality Checker

## What is it?
The Primality Checker determines whether or not a number is prime. It's backed by the [biginteger.js library](https://github.com/adamheins/biginteger.js), which provides arbitrarily-sized integers and checks primality using the [Miller-Rabin primality test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test).
